# This is a downloader middleware that can be used to get rendered javascript pages using webkit.
#
# this could be extended to handle form requests and load errors, but this is the bare bones code to get it done.
#
# the advantage over the selenium based approachs I've seen is that it only makes one request and you don't have to set up selenium.
